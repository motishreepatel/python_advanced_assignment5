    "'''Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors from more than one \n",
    "parent class. In multiple inheritance, a class can have multiple superclasses, and it inherits characteristics from all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a class that inherits from multiple parent classes is referred to as a derived class or subclass, and the parent classes are \n",
    "called base classes or superclasses. The derived class inherits attributes, methods, and behavior from all the base classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of multiple inheritance is that it allows the derived class to combine features and functionalities from different \n",
    "parent classes, promoting code reuse and modularity. This means that the derived class can inherit and use attributes and methods from \n",
    "all the base classes, allowing for greater flexibility and expressive power in class design. '''\n",
